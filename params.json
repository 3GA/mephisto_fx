{"name":"Mephisto III ","tagline":"A raspberry pi based internet radio with a Java FX UI","body":"# Updates\r\n\r\nThe software of the UI has been re-implemented and can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/syd711/mephisto_iii\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is the third internet radio I've build. It has been mostly been inspired by [this] (http://hackaday.com/2013/07/14/simple-looking-antique-internet-radio-has-a-lot-under-the-hood/) radio that has been published on \r\n[hackaday.com] (http://www.hackaday.com). The idea of attaching a cheap display to the Raspberry Pi for a radio made me thinking what kind of other information could be displayed. \r\nSince I already developed a Google music client for my last radio, I decided to build another one. Also, since I am mostly using the radio in the morning, I decided to add weather and time information to the UI too.\r\n\r\nHave a look on the results below!\r\n\r\n# The Case\r\n\r\nA BIG THANK YOU to my father who build the case. It is made out of oak. Here you see some pictures of the unfinished case:\r\n\r\n![Box 1](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6920.JPG)\r\n![Box 2](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG-20140108-WA0000.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Hardware\r\n\r\nBill of materials:\r\n* Wood box\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* 3x USB hub\r\n* USB WLAN stick\r\n* USB sound stick\r\n* 2x Visaton FRS8 speakers\r\n* 1x rotary encoder with push\r\n* 2x relays\r\n* 4,3 Zoll TFT disply (look for TFTs for cars)\r\n* 1x component cable\r\n* Logitech LS 11 pc speakers\r\n* 40x 20cm male - female jumper wire cable (connecting the rotary encoder with the Pi)\r\n* 1x micro USB cable (I've cut this cable to use one half for the Raspi power supply and the other one to connect the first relay)\r\n* plugs for the power supply\r\n\r\nThe hardware architecture of the radio is pretty simple. The Raspberry Pi with USB WLAN and USB sound has another USB cable attached that will power a relay. This relay enables the power supply for the \r\nLogitech amplifier and another relay that enables the display. I used the switch of the poti of the Logitech amplifier to control the power to the Raspberry Pi. \r\n\r\n\r\n# The Software (old version)\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this radio was to build a UI using JavaFX. There are a lot of demos out there that show that JavaFX is working on the Raspberry Pi, but I did not find much use cases.\r\nI wanted to have a nice UI and it took most of the time to build it. I haven't programmed JavaFX before and the functionality of the API is really impressing.\r\nUnfortunatly the performance of the Pi is not sufficient for all effects to run smoothly, especially when other threads are running (e.g. threads that load the UI for the Google\r\nmusic section that is loaded asynchronously). I would have have switched to a Beaglebone Black board, but unfortunatly the board does not provide a component out signal.\r\n\r\nAdditional software used:\r\n* [Gaugette's rotary encoder library] (https://github.com/guyc/py-gaugette)\r\n* mpc/mpd for music playback\r\n* A small python programm that communicates the rotary encoder state with the JavaFX programm via a socket\r\n\r\n# The Software (new version)\r\n\r\nI've re-implemented the UI using a 100% Java solution. See https://github.com/syd711/mephisto_iii for details.\r\nThe most important change is that the rotary encoder is now controlled via pi4j (http://pi4j.com/). \r\n\r\n# Related Work\r\n\r\nThe radio is based on the experiences I've made with building the [Mephisto I] (http://syd711.github.io/mephisto_i/) and [Mephisto II] (http://syd711.github.io/mephisto_ii/).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some additional fotos of the build process:\r\n\r\n![Wiring] (http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6918.JPG)\r\n\r\n![Wiring] (http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6919.JPG)\r\n\r\n![Finished Radio] (http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6922.JPG)\r\n\r\n![Finished Radio] (http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6923.JPG)\r\n\r\n![Finished Radio] (http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii/tn_IMG_6925.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated screenshots of the new UI:\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio1.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio2.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio3.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio4.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio5.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio6.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio7.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio8.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio9.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio10.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://www.paderpoint.net/radio/iii-new/radio11.png)\r\n","google":"UA-47253193-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
